Just, wow. I’m sitting here outside the theater — concrete is harder than a politician’s heart — and my mind’s like this popcorn crunching underfoot. A Working Man — what did I even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Feels like my eyes still adjusting to daylight after leaving that dark cave. The plot was as tangled as my earphones were this morning, and yet… I think I loved it? Maybe? There was this one scene — the guy with the... what was it, a hammer or a wrench? It’s all a smoothie mix in my brain right now. 

> Do you remember how the light was? It was like the director just dipped the entire set into a cup of burnt coffee — that perfect cowboy golden hour that makes you feel oddly nostalgic for things that never happened to you. Greasy, gritty, like someone brushed it through with machine oil — the type that makes engines rumble, you know?

Oh, geez, how it started. So the main character — was his name Alan or Aaron? — waking up in the most melancholy, bedroom-from-a-catalog kind of way. Beeping alarm clocks rhyming with my hiccupy thoughts. That first scene. Genius or just plain confusing? Can't tell if it’s my brain fuzz or the coffee I chugged after. 

Hey, someone asked if it’s available to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yet? Look, just tell them to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   first, like really 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. Multitasking eyebrows and weary glances — they’re the soul here. 

And the audience, munching and rustling plastic like it was part of the soundtrack. Part of me was there with them, vibrating with each crinkle, but also floating somewhere above, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨…what’s that phrase? A duck? Like a duck trying to fold laundry? All of this can mislead where logic lives, but that’s where I am... was.

Backend reminded me of those fancy ice cream sundaes — looks good, but somewhere, down there too deep, cold and sticky truth — some gritty undercurrent of existential dread and Meaning of Life vibes. Told my buddy last time, you never quite know when you’ll choke on some insightful kernel — if you even manage a full gasp.
